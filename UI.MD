“Design a beautiful, hackathon-style UI demo showing an animated data pipeline (like n8n) on the left and a chatbot panel on the right. The pipeline should visualize live data flow — boxes lighting up, connectors pulsing, and logs updating in real time (e.g., ‘Masking PII…’, ‘Encrypting record…’). The chatbot shows summaries and insights about the data. The design should feel clean, privacy-focused, and modern, using smooth animations, glassy panels, rounded corners, and a pristine aesthetic — not cluttered or ‘AI-sloppy’.
Development Stages:
Stage 1 — Static Demo: Build a static UI mock with n8n-style animation and a placeholder chatbot column (no backend).
Stage 2 — RAG Integration: Connect the chatbot panel to a RAG pipeline for real data summarization and retrieval.
Stage 3 — Live Simulation: Stream logs and updates into the node boxes to simulate real-time activity and data processing.”
